The AI Revolution:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans.
Example applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, and automated decision-making.
